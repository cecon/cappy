## 📖 **Advanced Usage**

### Workspace Scanning

The workspace scanner is the foundation of Cappy's intelligence:

```
Ctrl+Shift+P → "Cappy: Scan Workspace"
```

This will:
- 🔍 Discover all files in your project
- 📝 Parse code structure and documentation
- 🧠 Generate embeddings for semantic search
- 📊 Build a knowledge graph of relationships
- 💾 Store everything in local databases

### Graph Visualization

Explore your codebase visually:

```
Ctrl+Alt+G → Opens interactive graph
```

Features:
- **Node Types**: Files, functions, classes, interfaces
- **Relationships**: Dependencies, imports, documentation
- **Filtering**: By file type, confidence, date
- **Expansion**: Explore neighborhoods of related code
- **Metrics**: PageRank, centrality, clustering coefficients

### AI Chat Interface

Ask questions about your code:

```
"Where is the authentication logic implemented?"
"Show me all functions that handle user input"
"What files are related to the payment system?"
"Explain how the graph module works"
```

### Configuration

Create a `.cappyignore` file to exclude files from scanning:

```gitignore
# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.cache

# Large media files
*.mp4
*.avi

# Legacy code
legacy/
deprecated/
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

## ❓ FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is Cappy free to use?**
A: Yes, Cappy is open source and free to use under the MIT license.

**Q: Does Cappy send my code to external servers?**
A: By default, Cappy processes everything locally. Only if you configure external AI providers (like OpenAI) will data be sent externally, and only for embedding generation.

**Q: How much storage does Cappy use?**
A: Typically 1-5MB per 100 files, stored locally in your workspace's `.cappy` folder.

**Q: Can I use Cappy offline?**
A: Yes, with local embedding models. Some features may require internet for external AI providers.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why is the first scan slow?**
A: The initial scan processes all files and generates embeddings. Subsequent scans are incremental and much faster.

**Q: Can I exclude certain files from scanning?**
A: Yes, create a `.cappyignore` file in your project root with patterns to exclude.

**Q: Does Cappy work with large codebases?**
A: Yes, Cappy is designed to handle large projects efficiently with batch processing and incremental updates.

**Q: What happens if I close VS Code during a scan?**
A: Progress is saved incrementally. The next scan will continue from where it left off.

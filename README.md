## The Problem with Traditional Development

**Every task starts from zero.** You write code, encounter the same issues, google the same solutions, and repeat mistakes you've already solved. Your project's knowledge exists only in your head.

**Context switching kills productivity.** You jump between tasks without understanding their relationships, missing opportunities for reuse and creating inconsistencies.

**Prevention knowledge gets lost.** You fix a bug, but the knowledge of why it happened and how to prevent it vanishes into git commits and forgotten conversations.

---

## The CAPPY Solution: Context Orchestration

CAPPY 2.0 introduces **Context Orchestration** - your development environment becomes intelligent by automatically connecting tasks with relevant documentation, prevention rules, and related work.

### Intelligence That Grows With Your Project

**Every task is born smart.** When you describe a new task, CAPPY automatically:
- Finds relevant documentation from your project
- Applies prevention rules from similar past work  
- Suggests related tasks and dependencies
- Pre-populates context with architectural knowledge

**Your mistakes become system intelligence.** Failed approaches, debugging solutions, and hard-learned lessons transform into **Prevention Rules** that protect future work automatically.

**Context flows seamlessly.** Tasks aren't isolated - they inherit knowledge from your project's architecture, coding patterns, and accumulated wisdom.

---

## How It Works

### 1. **Intelligent Task Creation**
```
You: "I need to add JWT authentication"

CAPPY Context Discovery:
âœ“ Found: docs/auth/patterns.md
âœ“ Found: 3 prevention rules for auth category  
âœ“ Found: 1 related task (user-session-mgmt)
âœ“ Auto-applied: JWT null validation rule
âœ“ Category: auth (inferred automatically)

Result: Task born with complete context
```

### 2. **Natural Language Commands**
No memorizing syntax. Just express intent naturally:

- "create new task" â†’ Context discovery + XSD template
- "what's my current task?" â†’ Status with context summary  
- "analyze my project" â†’ Architecture mapping + knowledge extraction
- "work on current task" â†’ Context-aware execution

### 3. **Prevention Rules Evolution**
```xml
<rule category="auth" severity="high" auto_apply="true">
  Always validate JWT token existence before decode operations
</rule>
```

Errors become protection. Debugging becomes documentation. Learning compounds automatically.

### 4. **XSD-Structured Intelligence**
Every task follows a rigorous schema ensuring:
- Context section with discovered knowledge
- Execution steps with clear validation criteria
- Learning capture for continuous improvement
- Metrics tracking for effectiveness measurement

## Quick Start

### Install & Initialize
```bash
# Install from VS Code Marketplace
code --install-extension eduardocecon.cappy

# In VS Code Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
> CAPPY: Initialize Project
```

### Build Project Intelligence
```
# In GitHub Copilot Chat
"analyze my project structure"

# CAPPY maps your architecture, identifies components,
# and builds foundational context for intelligent task management
```

### Create Your First Smart Task
```
# In GitHub Copilot Chat  
"I need to add user authentication"

# Watch CAPPY automatically discover relevant context:
# - Related documentation
# - Applicable prevention rules  
# - Similar past tasks
# - Architectural dependencies
```

## Architecture: Context Orchestration Engine

```
.cappy/
â”œâ”€â”€ index/                    # Context orchestration brain
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tasks.json           # Task relationships and similarity
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ prevention.json      # Categorized prevention rules
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ context.json         # Knowledge graph connections
â”œâ”€â”€ tasks/                   # Active tasks (XSD compliant)
â”œâ”€â”€ history/                 # Completed tasks with learnings
â””â”€â”€ stack.md                 # Project architecture knowledge

docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/              # Auto-indexed documentation  
â”œâ”€â”€ prevention/              # Categorized prevention rules
â””â”€â”€ index/                   # Search and discovery indices
```

**Context Discovery Pipeline:**
1. **Semantic Analysis** - Extract keywords and intent from task description
2. **Category Inference** - Automatically categorize based on content patterns  
3. **Knowledge Retrieval** - Find relevant docs, rules, and related tasks
4. **Context Injection** - Pre-populate task with discovered intelligence
5. **Continuous Learning** - Capture outcomes for future context improvement

## Why Context Orchestration Changes Everything

### For Individual Developers
- **Eliminate repeated mistakes** through automatic prevention rule application
- **Accelerate task creation** with pre-populated relevant context
- **Maintain project knowledge** that grows more valuable over time
- **Reduce cognitive load** by having context served automatically

### For Development Teams
- **Knowledge sharing** through shared context indices and prevention rules
- **Consistency enforcement** via automatic application of team standards  
- **Onboarding acceleration** with comprehensive project context mapping
- **Quality improvement** through accumulated prevention intelligence

### For Complex Projects
- **Architectural awareness** in every task through context orchestration
- **Dependency management** via automatic relationship mapping
- **Technical debt prevention** through pattern recognition and rule application
- **Knowledge preservation** that survives team changes and time

## Real-World Impact

**Before CAPPY:** Task creation takes 15+ minutes of context gathering, reviewing similar work, and remembering edge cases.

**With CAPPY:** Describe intent in natural language. System instantly provides relevant context, prevention rules, and architectural knowledge. Task creation in under 2 minutes with superior context.

**The Multiplier Effect:** Each completed task makes the next one smarter. Prevention rules compound. Context quality improves. Development velocity increases over time.

## Technical Foundation

### XSD Schema Compliance
All tasks follow rigorous XML schema validation:
```xml
<task xmlns="https://cappy-methodology.dev/task/1.0" 
      category="auth" 
      id="jwt-implementation">
  <context discovery_timestamp="2025-01-15T10:30:00Z">
    <!-- Automatically populated by context orchestration -->
  </context>
  <execution>
    <!-- Smart task decomposition -->
  </execution>
  <completion>
    <!-- Learning capture for future intelligence -->
  </completion>
</task>
```

### Prevention Rule Intelligence
```xml
<rule id="jwt-null-check" 
      category="auth" 
      severity="high" 
      auto_apply="true">
  Always validate JWT token existence before decode operations
</rule>
```

### Context Discovery API
```typescript
interface ContextDiscovery {
  findRelevantDocs(keywords: string[]): DocReference[];
  getPreventionRules(category: TaskCategory): PreventionRule[];
  findSimilarTasks(context: TaskContext): RelatedTask[];
  inferCategory(description: string): TaskCategory;
